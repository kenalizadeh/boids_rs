* Calculating local flock's mean direction with [Rosetta Code Article](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Averages/Mean_angle)
* TODO: Currently boid movement is handled by the raycasting alone. So setting the target direction to local flock's mean direction does not work, since raycasting keeps updating it. Maybe add a weighted direction choices and update it from different sources?
